# Cookie-less GA3
GTM template for cookie-less GA3 tracking.

Client ID is randomly generated with every hit. It means that each hit is counted as a new user and a new session with 100 % bounce rate. Browser and device related data are collected only with consent.

Purpose of this template is to collect real pageview and hit count.


### This template does not affect IP address processing!

If you need to disable client's IP address processing by Google Analytics servers (i.e. to be GDPR compliant), you need to use Server-Side GTM or some other proxy.
